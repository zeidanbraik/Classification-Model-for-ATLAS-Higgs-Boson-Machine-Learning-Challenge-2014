# Classification Model for ATLAS Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge 2014
The Following Repository will contain all my work done during my France Internship summer 2021 at the IJCLab batimant 200 With Prof. David Rousseau

In this Internship the goal was to use a large data taken from an experiement done using the LHC to test for the Higgs boson, the goal was to determine the classification of such features, we have only two labels: signal and background, when we have signal we know higgs boson appeard and then decayed, two supervised machine learning models were applied: boosted decision trees and lightgbm in addition to that a neural network using tensorflow, the main criteria to validate the performance was significance not accuracy.
